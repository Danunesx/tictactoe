# tic-tac-toe

<p>
Application of a study in C# of a game of tic-tac-toe with player/user versus pc, the computer needs to win,
in this case the pc does not lose, always trying to tie.</p>

<p>
This study reminded me of programming discipline I in the first period of college, where I was challenged to create a tic-tac-toe game in python. </p>

<p>
Go to the bin folder and run the .exe file to play.</p>
